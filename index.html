        <h1>Tunebook ABC</h1>

        <p>
            This site contains a transcription into <a href="http://abcnotation.com/">ABC notation</a>
            of the tunes used by <a href="https://www.tuneworks.co.uk/">Tuneworks</a> in
            the workshops and sessions that they run at
            various UK folk festivals. While lots of versions of most of these tunes
            are already available on sites like <a href="https://thesession.org">The Session</a>, the ones
            here are intended to be note-for-note identical to the versions
            published in the
            <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/d6448b_974724120ad6465fbf8f417ff89daf0b.pdf">Tuneworks Tunebook</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>ABC Files</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="tunebook.abc">All the tunes as a single file</a>, suitable for further processing
                or importing into other programs. iPhone and iPad users might want to try out
                <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tunebook/id310492506">Tunebook</a> which
                seems to handle this file OK.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="abc/">Individual tunes</a> (or <a href="tunebook-abc.zip">all the tunes in a Zip archive</a>).
                Here (and elsewhere) the numbers at the start of the
                filename encode the number of the page in the original Tunebook on which the tune appears
                and its place on that page.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other formats</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>A compact index to all the tunes, just showing the first couple of bars

        <h2>Mistakes</h2>

        <p>
            The transcription is bound to contain mistakes, defined as (almost) anything that isn't the same as it is in the
            Tuneworks Tunebook (ignoring minor stylistic differences and the differences listed below).
            Likewise, the various derived formats are unlikely to be error free even if the ABC
            transcriptions are correct.
            Please report any mistakes that you find, either by creating a GitHub
            issue or (better) a pull request, or (if that doesn't mean anything to you) by emailing
            Jon Warbrick &lt;jon.warbrick@googlemail.com&gt;.</p>

        <p>
            The following differences from Tuneworks Tunebook are expected:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each tune stands on its own, rather than being part of a set. As a result, they
                all include time signatures, and the key change warning at the end of 'The Banshee'
            isn't included.</li>
            <li>What would be a final 'e' at the end of the first section repeat in My Darling Asleep is
            omitted, largely because abc2midi complains that it makes the repeat bar too long.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>

        <p>
            This work was inspired by <a href="http://www.pghardy.net/concertina/tunebooks/">Paul
            Hardy's Tunebooks</a> and his
            <a href="http://www.pghardy.net/concertina/tunebooks/tunebook_process.html">tunebook process page</a> informed the initial processing pipeline. Robin Clark of
            <a href="http://www.dulcimers.co.uk">Bird Rock Dulcimers</a> fixed a number of mistakes
            in the Dulcimer versions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The master copies of these tunes, along with the tools used to produce everything else,
            can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/jw35/tunebook-abc">https://github.com/jw35/tunebook-abc</a>.
