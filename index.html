        <h1>Tunebook ABC</h1>

        <p>
        	This site contains a transcription into <a href="http://abcnotation.com/">ABC notation</a>
            of the tunes used by <a href="https://www.tuneworks.co.uk/">Tuneworks</a> in
            support of the workshops and sessions that they run at
            a number of UK folk festivals. While most of these tunes
            are already available on sites such as The Session, the ones
            here are intended to be note-for-note identical to the versions
            in the
            <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/d6448b_974724120ad6465fbf8f417ff89daf0b.pdf">Tuneworks Tunebook</a>.
        </p>

        <ul>
        	<li>
        		<a href="tunebook.abc">All the tunes as a single file</a>, suitable for further processing
        	    or importing into other programs. iPhone and iPad users might want to try out
                <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tunebook/id310492506">Tunebook</a> which
                seems to handle this file OK.
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		<a href="abc/">One file per tune</a>. Here (and elsewhere) the numbers on the start of the
        	    filename encode the number of the page in the original Tunebook on which the tune appears,
        	    and the tune's place on that page.
        	</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        	This site also contains the results of processing the ABC files into various oher formats:
        </p>

    		the first couple of bars (handy when trying to remember the notes for a particular
    	tune).</li>

    	D whistle tabs.</li>

        <p>
        	This work was partly inspired by <a href="http://www.pghardy.net/concertina/tunebooks/">Paul
        	Hardy's Tunebooks</a> and his
        	<a href="http://www.pghardy.net/concertina/tunebooks/tunebook_process.html">tunebook processs page</a>
        	heavily informed the processing pipeline.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The master copies of these tunes, along with the tools used to produce everything else,
        	can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/jw35/tunebook-abc">https://github.com/jw35/tunebook-abc</a>.
