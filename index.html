        <h1>Tunebook ABC</h1>

        <p>
            This site contains a transcription into <a href="http://abcnotation.com/">ABC notation</a>
            of the tunes used by <a href="https://www.tuneworks.co.uk/">Tuneworks</a> in
            support of the workshops and sessions that they run at
            a number of UK folk festivals. While most of these tunes
            are already available on sites such as The Session, the ones
            here are intended to be note-for-note identical to the versions
            in the
            <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/d6448b_974724120ad6465fbf8f417ff89daf0b.pdf">Tuneworks Tunebook</a>.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="tunebook.abc">All the tunes as a single file</a>, suitable for further processing
                or importing into other programs. iPhone and iPad users might want to try out
                <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tunebook/id310492506">Tunebook</a> which
                seems to handle this file OK.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="abc/">One file per tune</a>. Here (and elsewhere) the numbers on the start of the
                filename encode the number of the page in the original Tunebook on which the tune appears,
                and the tune's place on that page.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This site also contains the results of processing the ABC files into various oher formats:

            <li>A compact index to all the tunes, just showing the first couple of bars
                (handy when trying to remember the notes for a particular tune or identify a tune from its start):

        <p>
            This work was partly inspired by <a href="http://www.pghardy.net/concertina/tunebooks/">Paul
            Hardy's Tunebooks</a> and his
            <a href="http://www.pghardy.net/concertina/tunebooks/tunebook_process.html">tunebook processs page</a>
            heavily informed the processing pipeline.
        </p>

        <p>
            The master copies of these tunes, along with the tools used to produce everything else,
            can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/jw35/tunebook-abc">https://github.com/jw35/tunebook-abc</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The transcription is bound to contain mistakes, defined as (almost) anything that isn't the same as it is in the
            Tuneworks Tunebook (ignoring minor stylistic differences and the differences listed below).
            Please report any mistakes that you find, either by creating a GitHib
            issue or (better) a pull request, or (if that doesn't mean anything to you) by emailing
            Jon Warbrick &lt;jon.warbrick@googlemail.com&gt;.</p>

        <p>
            The following differences from Tuneworks Tunebook are expected:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each tune stands on its own, rather than being part of a set. As a result, they
                all include time signatures, and the key change warning at the end of 'The Banshee'
            isn't included.</li>
            <li>What would be a final 'e' at the end of the first section repeat in My Darking Asleep is
            omitted, largely because abc2midi complains that it makes the repeat bar too long.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
