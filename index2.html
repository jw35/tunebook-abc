        <h1>Tunebook ABC - Second Edition</h1>

        <p>
            This site contains a transcription into <a href="http://abcnotation.com/">ABC notation</a>
            of the second edition of the tunes used by <a href="https://www.tuneworks.co.uk/">Tuneworks</a> in
            the workshops and sessions that they run at
            various UK folk festivals. While versions of most of these tunes
            are already available on sites like <a href="https://thesession.org">The Session</a>, the ones
            here are intended to be note-for-note identical to the versions
            published in the
            <a href="https://www.tuneworks.co.uk/_files/ugd/d6448b_04b3182c3a8948789a7eda6b9d1b6e8c.pdf">Tuneworks Tunebook (2nd ed)</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A <a href=".">transcription of the tunes in the first edition of the Tunebook</a> is also available.
        </p>

        <h2>ABC Files</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="tunebook2.abc">All the tunes as a single file</a>, suitable for further processing
                or importing into other programs. iPhone and iPad users might want to try out
                <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tunebook/id310492506">Tunebook</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-craic/id586009292">the Craic</a> which seem to handle this file OK.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="abc2/">Individual tunes</a> (or <a href="tunebook2-abc.zip">all the tunes in a Zip archive</a>).
                Here (and elsewhere) the numbers at the start of the
                filename encode the number of the page in the original Tunebook on which the tune appears
                and its place on that page.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other formats</h2>

        <p>
            This site also contains the results of processing the ABC files into various other formats:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="midi2/">All the tunes converted to MIDI files</a> (or <a href="tunebook2-midi.zip">all the MIDI files in a Zip archive)</a></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="mp3-2/">All the tunes converted to mp3 audio files</a> (or <a href="tunebook2-mp3.zip">all the mp3 files in a Zip archive)</a></li>
        </ul>

       <ul>
            <li><a href="tunebook2.pdf">tunebook.pdf</a> A printable copy of the tunes
            using much the same layout as the Tuneworks original.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>The printed tunebook for transposing instruments:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="tunebook2-eflat.pdf">tunebook-eflat.pdf</a> to E&#9837; (e.g. for alto sax)</li>
                    <li><a href="tunebook2-bflat.pdf">tunebook-bflat.pdf</a> to B&#9837; (e.g. for clarinet, soprano or tenor sax )</li>
                    <li><a href="tunebook2-bassclef.pdf">tunebook-bassclef.pdf</a> in the bass clef</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>One tune per page for various instruments:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="tunebook2-guitar-dwhistle.pdf">tunebook-guitar-dwhistle.pdf</a> with Guitar chord diagrams and D Whistle tabs.</li>
                    <li><a href="tunebook2-mandolin.pdf">tunebook-mandolin.pdf</a> with Mandolin tabs.</li>
                    <li><a href="tunebook2-ukulele.pdf">tunebook-ukulele.pdf</a> with Ukulele chord diagrams.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>A compact index to all the tunes, just showing the first couple of bars
                (handy when trying to remember the notes for a particular tune or identify a tune's name from its start):
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="cheatsheet2.pdf">cheatsheet.pdf</a> just the tunes.</li>
                    <li><a href="cheatsheet2-dwhistle.pdf">cheatsheet-dwhistle.pdf</a> including D Whistle tabs.</li>
                    <li><a href="cheatsheet2-mandolin.pdf">cheatsheet-mandolin.pdf</a> including Mandolin tabs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mistakes</h2>

        <p>
            The transcription is bound to contain mistakes, defined as (almost) anything that isn't the same as it is in the
            Tuneworks Tunebook (ignoring minor stylistic differences and the differences listed below).
            Likewise, the various derived formats are unlikely to be error free even if the ABC
            transcriptions are correct.
            Please report any mistakes that you find, either by creating a GitHub
            issue or (better) a pull request, or (if that doesn't mean anything to you) by emailing
            Jon Warbrick <a href="mailto:jon.warbrick@googlemail.com">jon.warbrick@googlemail.com</a>.</p>

        <p>
            The following differences from Tuneworks Tunebook are expected:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The annotation for the second time bar at the end of the A part of 'My Darling Asleep'
                has been removed to stop <i>abc2midi</i> seeing bars 8 and 9 as having the wrong number of
                time units.
            </li>
            <li>The annotation for the first and second time bar at the end of the A part of 'Oranges in Bloom'
                has been removed because the two endings are identical and to stop <i>abc2midi</i> seeing bars 9 and
                10 as having the wrong number of time units.
            </li>
            <li>The D and E notes at the end of the first time bar at the end of the A part of 'Freshwater Fran' have been
                removed as they (incorrectly) repeat the the first two notes of the tune.
            </li>
            <li>The opening repeat marker in the B part of 'Dearest Dicky' has been moved to the start of the first full bar so
                that the leading B isn't played the second time through and to stop <i>abc2midi</i> seeing bar 8 as having
                the wrong number of time units.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>

        <p>
            This work was inspired by <a href="http://www.pghardy.net/concertina/tunebooks/">Paul
            Hardy's Tunebooks</a> and his
            <a href="http://www.pghardy.net/concertina/tunebooks/tunebook_process.html">tunebook process page</a>
            informed the initial processing pipeline. John Hinton of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/johnhintonmusician">John
            Hinton Music</a> and Graham Louth provided much-needed music theory advice. Vince Hodgson of Tuneworks kindly provided an ABC export from the master copy of the second edition Tunebook.
