Tunebook 2nd edition
====================

Probably errors
---------------

* In Flatwater Fran (p24) the DE notes at the end of the First time bar at the
  end of the A part should be deleted as they (incorrectly) include the the
  first two notes of the tune in the repeat.

* In Dearest Dicky (p31) the B at the start of the 'B' part is incorrectly
  repeated the second time through. This can be fixed either by moving
  the 'B' part start repeat to just before the first full bar, or with
  separate first time and second time bars at the end of the A part, with the
  First time bar being as is, but the Second time bar adding the b note which
  is currently shown as the first note of the B part (which should be
  deleted).

Thoughts
--------

* Are the final bars of Saddle the Pony (p5) correct?  Should the bar before
  the final repeat sign be a First time and the final bar Second time, or
  whether it is intended that both be played second time through (i.e. as
  an 'out' bar)?

* Manx Jig (p30) and Morrison's (p8) might be easier to read if the B part was
  written out in full without the repeat (albeit it would then be six rows
  rather than five).

* In Orange in Bloom (p18) is the Second time bar at the end of the A part
  needed, since it is almost identical to the First time bar (though there is
  a "G" chord on one and not the other)?
