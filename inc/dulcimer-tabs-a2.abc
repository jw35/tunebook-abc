%%This is a rendering of the Tuneworks tunebook including simple tabs for Mountain Dulcimers that have their
%%melody string(s) tuned to 'A' (D-A-A, etc.). These melodies will only
%%work if the drone strings are tuned appropriately for the corresponding tune's key.

%%Instruments without an '8\u00bd' fret are going to struggle to play anything in
%%the key of 'G' because they won't be able to play 'C\u266e'.
