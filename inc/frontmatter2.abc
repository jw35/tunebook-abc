%%This tunebook is the result of a transcription into ABC notation (http://abcnotation.com/)
%%of the second edition of the Tuneworks Tunebook, provided by 
%%Tuneworks (https://www.tuneworks.co.uk/) in support of the workshops
%%and sessions they run at various UK folk festivals. While versions of most of these tunes
%%are already available in ABC on sites like The Session, the ones here are
%%intended to be note-for-note identical to the versions in the Tuneworks Tunebook.
